titly.js
================

Node, Sockets, OSC, ACCELEROMETER!!!, and mobile.  Cool!

This is a quick and dirty example of using Node.js to create a browser based OSC-controller

Node.js is used as as server, specifically relying on the express library to simplify routing.  
Node-osc is used to create an Open Sound Control client to send messages on a local network.
Socket.IO is used to create a web socket and send messages between the client and server.

The front end is nasty and I'm going to do a cool touch thing.

This of course is also relying on jquery and jquery mobile.

Then I am also using a jquery extension called Kontrol https://github.com/aterrien/jQuery-Kontrol
This is to create all the UI elements...

Included in here you will also find a pd patch.  This is preconfigured to listen to the osc messages
being sent by node.js.  This is done using a simple API... this could be an interesting idea to expand upon.

To get starting you need to obviously have node.js and npm installed
http://nodejs.org/download/

To get this running on the beagle I needed to install install libavahi-compat-libdnssd-dev to get mdns working

You will need to modify public/js/tilty.js on line 8 to specify the ip of the device running the sockets... 
this should be able to be generated by the server and not hard coded
